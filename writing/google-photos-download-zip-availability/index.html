You select up to 500 photos or videos, hit &ldquo;Download&rdquo;, wait a minute or so (depending on the size), and your browser will start downloading the ZIP.</p><p>These are fairly large files (around 8 GB each in my case), and I was just heading out the door, so I had to cancel a few of them.</p><p>Later on, when I pulled out my laptop, I decided on a whim to use the &ldquo;retry&rdquo; functionality on the Chrome &ldquo;Download history&rdquo; page. Lo and behold, it worked! I had assumed the files would be deleted as soon as the connection was closed, but apparently they are kept for quite some time (at least 12 hours or so).</p><p>That then led me to open up an incognito window to attempt the download link there. Somewhat reassuringly, it prompted me to login to my Google account.</p><p>The more you know!</p></article></main><footer id=footer>Copyright © 2022–2024 Joel Isaac Stewart Davies-Kitching</footer></body></html>
