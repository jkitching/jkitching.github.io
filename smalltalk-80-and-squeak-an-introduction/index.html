Smalltalk is the first fully object-oriented language, older than the great K&R C itself.</p><h1 id=dabble-db-takes-my-smalltalk-virginity>Dabble DB takes my Smalltalk virginity</h1><p>In January 2009, through my university, I started a co-op work term with a company called Smallthought Systems. They&rsquo;re the guys behind the award-winning web app <a href=http://dabbledb.com/>Dabble DB</a>.</p><p>On the job listing it noted applicants would be programming in Smalltalk, which I had never heard of at the time. Here&rsquo;s a conversation we had on my first day:</p><blockquote><p>Them: Ever programmed in Smalltalk?</p><p>Me: Nope.</p><p>Them: Well, trust us, once you&rsquo;&rsquo;ve tried it there&rsquo;&rsquo;s no going back. Or if you do have to program with something else, you&rsquo;&rsquo;ll hate every minute of it.</p></blockquote><p>I laughed. Of course nothing that was decades old could be so radically ground-breaking. Boy was I wrong.</p><h1 id=and-you-call-this-programming>And you call this programming?</h1><p>I&rsquo;m not going to lie&mdash;Squeak is weird. With Squeak, you don&rsquo;t open up your text editor, type out some code, hit &ldquo;save&rdquo;, compile said file, and run the binary.</p><p>You use the Squeak Virtual Machine to open up an image&mdash;a saved state of an entire implementation of Smalltalk&mdash;wherein everything is programmed in Squeak. The graphical interface is programmed in Squeak. The compiler is programmed in Squeak. And everything is modifiable.</p><h1 id=some-history>Some history</h1><p>Those images themselves are actually descendants of the one used by researchers at XEROX PARC. Nowadays, there are a number of different implementations forked from the original image, including a free and open-source one called <a href=http://www.squeak.org/>Squeak</a> (if you listen to <a href=https://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly>FLOSS Weekly</a> you&rsquo;ll hear about it in <a href=https://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly/episodes/29>Episode 29</a>, in which the Smalltalk and Squeak co-creator Dan Ingalls is interviewed).</p></article></main><footer id=footer>Copyright Â© 2022 Joel Isaac Stewart Davies-Kitching</footer></body></html>
