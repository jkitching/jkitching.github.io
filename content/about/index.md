Hello!  My name is Joel Isaac Stewart Davies-Kitching, or 金卓爾, and I'm a Canadian software engineer based (lost?) in Taipei.

I worked on the Chrome OS team in Taiwan for seven years, took a Covid sabbatical, and am now looking for my next opportunity.

I enjoy yoga and hiking and biking, brew kombucha in my spare time, often accidentally find myself in YouTube videos, and am just about finished reading [三體](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)) after four years of mind-bendingly slow progress.

You can contact me at `{ my first name } AT jkweb.ca`.
